Ballerina allows you to code with a statically-typed, interaction-centric programming language where microservices, APIs, and streams are first-class constructs. You can use your preferred IDE and CI/CD tools. Discover, consume, and share packages that integrate endpoints with Ballerina Central. Build binaries, containers, and Kubernetes artifacts and deploy as chaos-ready services on cloud and serverless infrastructure. Integrate distributed endpoints with simple syntax for resiliency, circuit breakers, transactions, and events.
