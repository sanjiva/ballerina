    F{{name}} - gRPC resource name. This applies only for client streaming and bidirectional streaming
                where we can define only one resource. In order to generate proto file, we need resource name.
    F{{clientStreaming}} - gRPC client streaming service flag. This applies only for servicestub streaming and
                           bidirectional streaming. Flag sets to true, if the service is client/bidirectional streaming.
    F{{serverStreaming}} - gRPC server streaming service flag. This applies only for client streaming and
                           bidirectional streaming. Flag sets to true, if the service is bidirectional streaming.
