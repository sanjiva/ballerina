    Represents the properties which are used to configure DB connection pool.

    F{{connectionInitSql}} SQL statement that will be executed after every new connection creation before adding it
                             to the pool
    F{{dataSourceClassName}} Name of the DataSource class provided by the JDBC driver. This is used on following scenarios.
       1. In JDBC client when DB specific properties are required (which are given with dbOptions)
       2. In any data client in which XA transactions enabled by isXA property and need to provide a custom XA implementation.
    F{{autoCommit}} Auto-commit behavior of connections returned from the pool
    F{{isXA}} Whether Connections are used for a distributed transaction
    F{{maximumPoolSize}} Maximum size that the pool is allowed to reach, including both idle and in-use connections
    F{{connectionTimeout}} Maximum number of milliseconds that a client will wait for a connection from the pool. Default is 30 seconds
    F{{idleTimeout}} Maximum amount of time that a connection is allowed to sit idle in the pool. Default is 10 minutes
    F{{minimumIdle}} Minimum number of idle connections that pool tries to maintain in the pool. Default is same as maximumPoolSize
    F{{maxLifetime}} Maximum lifetime of a connection in the pool. Default is 30 minutes
    F{{validationTimeout}} Maximum amount of time that a connection will be tested for aliveness. Default 5 seconds
