# Language Server User Guide
Ballerina Language Server provides code intelligence for ballerina file editing. It supports editor features such as diagnostics, auto-completion, go-to-definition, code refactoring and more. A list of currently supported features  can be found below. 

Currently the Ballerina Language Server has been integrated to Ballerina [VSCode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ballerina.ballerina) and Ballerina Composer. All the examples are given below using VSCode if you are using a different editor the trigger keys can be different.
