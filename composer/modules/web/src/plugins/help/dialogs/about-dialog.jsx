                    Ballerina Composer provides a flexible and powerful browser-based tool for creating your
                    Ballerina programs. You can build your integrations by creating sequence diagrams, dragging
                    elements from a tool palette onto a canvas. As you build the diagrams, the underlying code
                    is written for you, which you can work with in the Source view. You can also use the Swagger
                    view to define services by writing Swagger definitions. You can switch seamlessly between
                    the Design view, Source view, and Swagger view and create your programs in the way that
                    you like to work.
