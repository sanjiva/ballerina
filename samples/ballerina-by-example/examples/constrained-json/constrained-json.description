// A json can be constrained with a struct definition to restrict the fields of the json to that of the
// struct. If tried to access a field with an invalid field as per the struct definition or initialize
// a json with invalid fields, this will cause a compilation error. Restricting the fields of the json will
// enforce the format of the json variable.
