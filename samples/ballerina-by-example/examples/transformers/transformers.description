// Transformers are used to convert a variable of one type to another. Additional arguments
// can also be passed to a transformer for the conversion. The transformer can be defined
// as an high level construct, and can be used within any expression using the type
// conversion syntax.

// Transformer may or may not have a name. A transformer without a name is treated
// as the default transformer to convert from the source type to the target type. A transformer
// with a name can be explicitly invoked during a type conversion.
// This sample is about transforming an input struct variable to an output struct variable.
