//JSON is a textual format for representing a collection of values:
//a simple value (string, number, “true”, “false”, “null”), an array of values or an object.
//Ballerina has a single type named “json” that can represent any JSON value.
//Thus it is a built-in union type in Ballerina whose value can be any one of a string, a float, a boolean, an array of any or a map of any.
