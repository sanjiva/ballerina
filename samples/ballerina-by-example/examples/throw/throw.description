//Thrown errors are just like exceptions and cause the call stack to be unwound
//until a matching catcher is found.

//In Ballerina, throwing an error means, something unexpected has happened that
// shouldnâ€™t occur during the normal operation, and the code that handles the thrown
// error is not expected to be able to do much to recover from it. It may log the
// error and abort the execution.

//Ballerina encourages developers, NOT to use 'throw' for handling program related
//errors (i.e header not found, Data mismatched error etc), but in an error situation
//where it couldn't handle the error by itself, like accessing a Null Reference,
//Connection Closed/TimeOut and OutOfMemory etc.
