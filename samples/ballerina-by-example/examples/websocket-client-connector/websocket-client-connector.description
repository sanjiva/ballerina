// This example explains the basic WebSocket client connector.
// After defining a client connector in a service you should give a client service to handle inbound messages from remote WebSocket server.
// Those messages will be received to client service which is bound to the client connector.
// If and only if the client connector defined inside a WebSocket service then you can use pushText and broadcastText functions to
// send messages from the client service to the original clients who have connected to WebSocket service.
