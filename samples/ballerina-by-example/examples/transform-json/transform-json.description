// Transform statement is used to transform any chosen variable(s) or argument(s),
// using data from other variable(s) or argument(s). The variable(s) or argument(s)
// getting changed are known as output and variable(s) or argument(s) that supply values
// for output is known as input. Transform statements is a set of assignments which
// make up the transformation from input to output. This sample is about transforming
// an input struct variable to an output 'json' variable which is constraint by a struct type.
