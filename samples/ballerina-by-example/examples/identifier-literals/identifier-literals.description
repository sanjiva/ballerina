//Ballerina supports Identifier literals, that means, it is possible to define
//  symbols without restrictions like "no spaces, no special character" etc. in Ballerina.

//Ballerina allows identifiers to contain spaces and use any set of Unicode code points.

//We use identifiers to name, functions, service, structs, variables etc.
//In Ballerina, identifiers will be defined as "traditional" identifiers or identifier literals.
//Identifier literals allows you to use spaces and any set of Unicode code points.
