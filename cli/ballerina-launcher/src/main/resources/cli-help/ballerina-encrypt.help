NAME
    Ballerina encrypt - Encrypt sensitive configuration values 
    
SYNOPSIS
    ballerina encrypt 

DESCRIPTION
     Encrypt command performs symmetric encryption of sensitive 
     configuration values using AES, CBC mode with PKCS#5 padding. 

     Configuration values containing sensitive information such as 
     passwords and secrets should be encrypted to maintain 
     confidentiality. 

     Once executed, the encrypt command will prompt for the value to 
     be encrypted and a secret that is used as the AES encryption /     
     decryption key.

     The encrypted configuration value can then be used as a 
     configuration value by placing the encrypt command output in a 
     configuration file or by passing it as a runtime argument.

     The Ballerina Config API will automatically decrypt the
     configuration values on demand.

OPTIONS
     Ballerina encrypt command takes no options.

DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR
     AES, CBC mode with PKCS#5 padding will be used to encrypt the 
     provided value by using the provided encryption key.

EXAMPLES
     Encrypt sensitive data
     $ ballerina encrypt
