NAME
    Ballerina test - Run Ballerina tests and display a summary of 
    test results.

SYNOPSIS
    ballerina test [-lg|--list-groups] [--groups <test_group, ...>] 
        [--disable-groups <test_group, ...>] [--sourceroot <path>]
        [-e] [--debug <port>] [-c <config_file>]
        [--exclude-packages <packages, ...>]
        [--config <config_file>] [-B] [<balfile>|<packagename>]


DESCRIPTION
    Ballerina test command allows you to compile and run Ballerina 
    test sources and prints a summary of test results. You can 
    execute tests in a single test file, a test package, or an 
    entire Ballerina project.
    
    Use ballerina test without any parameters to execute tests for 
    the entire project.
    
    Use ballerina test <packagename> to execute tests within the 
    specified package.
    
    Use ballerina test <balfile> to execute the given Ballerina test 
    file. Note that imports from other packages will not work for 
    file executions. File path can be a relative or absolute.

OPTIONS

     -lg
     --list-groups
         Lists the test groups available in the test files. Groups are 
         tags that are added to test functions. The groups are used to
         control the execution of test functions by specifying a  
         group or a set of groups that need to be executed in a test 
         run. A test function can be grouped with the groups parameter 
         within the @test:config annotation.

     --groups <test_group, ...>              
         Specify test groups to be executed. Groups are tags that are 
         added to test functions. The groups are used to control the 
         execution of test functions by specifying a group or a set of 
         groups that need to be executed in a test run. A test 
         function can be grouped with the groups parameter within the
         @test:config annotation.

     --disable-groups <test_group, ...>      
         Specify test groups to be excluded. Groups are tags that are 
         added to test functions. The groups are used to control the 
         execution of test functions by specifying a group or a set of 
         groups that need to be executed in a test run. A test 
         function can be grouped with the groups parameter within the
         @test:config annotation.

     --sourceroot <path>         
         Location of the remote project root with source files. All 
         executions will be relative to the path provided for 
         sourceroot. 

     -e <key=value>
         Sets Ballerina environment parameters as key/value pairs.
         If multiple parameters need to be provided, each parameter
         has to be specified using its own -e flag. Details of the
         environment parameters that the Ballerina standard library
         packages support can be found in the relevant API
         documentation.

     --debug <port>               
         Remote debug Ballerina tests over the port given.   

     --exclude-packages <packages, ...>
         Specify the packages to be excluded.

     -c <config_file>
     --config <config_file>
         Provides the path to a Ballerina configuration file.
         The configuration file format is a subset of the TOML file
         format. It supports key/value pairs, tables, comments, and
         string, int, float and boolean value types.

     -B <key=value>
         Provides Ballerina VM options to be used by the runtime
         when executing a Ballerina program or package. VM options
         are key/value pairs. If multiple VM options need to be
         provided, each option has to be specified using its
         own -B flag.

EXAMPLES
     Run all tests in the current project
     $ ballerina test

     Run all tests in hello_service_test.bal  
     $ ballerina test hello_service_test.bal 

     Run tests in math package  
     $ ballerina test math

     List all test groups in all Ballerina source files in 
     tests 
     $ ballerina test -lg tests 

     Run only the set of tests belonging to group_x in all Ballerina 
     source files in tests 
     $ ballerina test --groups group_x  tests
