ballerina: Oh no, something really went wrong. Bad. Sad.

There should be a file named "ballerina-internal.log" in the current directory.
If you are able to share with us the code that broke Ballerina then
we would REALLY appreciate if you would report this to us:
go to https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang/issues and
create a bug report with both this log file and the sample code.

We thank you for helping make us better dancers.
