//Workers in Ballerina allow developers to delegate their tasks to parallel
//running threads (workers).
//Workers can be declared within functions, actions or resources.
//The logic written inside a worker block is executed in a parallel thread
//to the default (main) thread.
//Worker execution starts immediately after invoking the relevant function,
//action, or resource that encloses the worker(s).
