//Lambdas are simply a syntactic shortcut for defining a function inline.
//In comparison to a normal function definition, the only missing part here
//is the name. Semantically, these inline anonymous functions will not be
//allowed to have any references to in-scope variables other than to global
//or package level variables. Thus, it behaves exactly like a regular function
//except that it cannot be called in another place as it has no name.
