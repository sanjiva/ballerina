//Throwing an error generally means an unexpected error has happend, and the code that
// handles the thrown error is not expected to be able to do much to recover from it,
// rather than perhaps catch and log it.
// Throwing errors will be very rare and will happen under exceptional circumstances such as server going out of memory, running out of disk space.
