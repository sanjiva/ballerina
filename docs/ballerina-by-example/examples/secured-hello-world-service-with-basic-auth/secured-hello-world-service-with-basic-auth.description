// A service can be secured using basic authentication and optionally, authorization.
// The userstore used is a simple file based one. The file based userstore stores
// usernames, password hashes for authentication purposes, as well as groups and scopes
// for authorization purposes. Ballerina uses the concept of scopes for authorization.
// A resource declared in a Service can be bound to a scope. A scope is mapped to one
// or more groups. To access the resource, a user need to be in the same groups to
// which the corresponding scope is mapped.
