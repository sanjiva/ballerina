# Packaging and Running Programs

## About Ballerina packages

A Ballerina program can consist of a number of Ballerina files, which you can organize into packages simply by creating subdirectories as follows:

```
program-name/
  package-directory-1/
  package-directory-2/
  ...
```

Each Ballerina entity (function, service, etc.) has a globally unique qualified name consisting of its package name and entity name (the file name is NOT part of the entity's name) concatenated with periods. For example, let's say you have a service named StockQuoteService inside a file named `foo.bal`, which is located in the following directory structure:

```
myProgram
  resources
  services
    foo.bal
```
The StockQuoteService entity's fully qualified name would be: `myProgram.services.StockQuoteService` 

When you create a Ballerina program in the Composer, you can declare the program's package in the Package box in the upper left corner of the canvas. Or you can simply type `package <package-name>;` in the Source view. Using the StockQuoteService example, you would add `package myProgram.services;` at the top of `foo.bal`. When you declare a package in the program file, be sure to save the file in the correct directory hierarchy to match that package, such as saving `foo.bal` in the `myProgram/services` directory as shown above. If a package is not declared, the program will be in the default (unnamed) package. 

**Note:** When you name your files, directories, and packages, and when you name your Ballerina elements such as services and resources, be sure to avoid using the [reserved names](lang-overview.md#reserved-names).

The `<program-name>` directory contains all the code that the developer writes and may have files in multiple packages (and therefore multiple directories) as in the example above. However, third-party dependencies (which are specified via import statements as described below) are discovered from a [repository](#the-ballerina-repository) and are not physically located within the program source hierarchy. 

Each Ballerina program can have at most one `main()` function, which serves as the entry point for command-line execution, and zero or more services that are exposed as network entry points when the program is run as a service. Therefore, when organizing your files under a `<program-name>` directory, be sure that there is no more than one file containing the `main()` function. 

## Importing packages
To import a package into your program, you can use the Imports box in the upper left corner of the canvas, or simply type `import <package-name>;` in the Source view. 

All built-in Ballerina library functions and connectors are defined in the `ballerina.*` packages. You donâ€™t need to add import statements for system packages that start with `ballerina.lang.*` because they are imported by default and can be accessed by qualifying the symbol with the last part of the package name. For example, you can access all message data type related functions (which live in the `ballerina.lang.message` package) as `message:FunctionName`. 

## Ballerina libraries

You can package collections of Ballerina code as a library so that the resulting package can be shared. Such a library can contain code coming from one or more Ballerina packages.

A Ballerina library is organized similar to a program:

```
library-name/
  package-directory-1/
  package-directory-2/
  ...
```

To install a library into your repository, you add it as follows:

```
ballerina repository add [library-archive-name]
```

If the library archive name is not specified, the current directory is assumed to be a library source directory and is inserted into the repository. Library archives have the file extension `.blz`.

**Note**: In the current release, you can use existing libraries, but you cannot yet build your own library archives.

## The Ballerina repository

The Ballerina repository is a collection of Ballerina libraries. 

The Ballerina language distribution ships with a built-in repository containing all the core language libraries (containing the `ballerina.*` packages) as well as third-party libraries. In addition to the default repository, every developer can have a private repository. The default location of the private repository is `~/.ballerina`, but you can change the location by setting the BALLERINA_REPOSITORY environment variable.

A repository is organized as follows:

```
repository-directory/
  src/
    dir1/
      version/
        .bal files in package dir1 of the indicated version
      dir2/
        version/ # one version
          .bal files in package dir1.dir2 of the indicated version
        version/ # another version
          .bal files in package dir1.dir2 of the indicated version
      dir3/
        version/
          .bal files in ...
    dir4/
    dir5/
      version/
        .bal files in ...
```

## Creating Ballerina archives

You can execute Ballerina programs directly from the program directory. However, if you want to create a self-contained package containing all the program code and third-party dependencies, you must build the program into a packaged format. When a program is packaged using the `ballerina build` command, the resulting archive will contain not just the Ballerina files that contain the main function and/or services, but also all the Ballerina packages that are imported by all the code needed to execute the main function and/or services. If you want to host a Ballerina program in [WSO2 Integration Cloud](http://wso2.com/integration), you build a Ballerina service archive (`.bsz`) as described below and upload it to the Cloud. 

To create an archive, take the following steps:

1. Make sure the Ballerina files you are archiving each have the correct package declaration at the top of the file and are in a directory structure that reflects that package path as described at the top of this page. 
1. Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory **above** the package root directory. For example, for the StockQuoteService example described at the top of this page, if the `myProgram` directory is in the root C:\ directory on Windows, you would navigate to C:\ at the command line.
1. Use one of the following `ballerina build` commands to create the archive. The syntax below assumes the Ballerina `bin` directory is in your path. If it is not, specify its path before the `ballerina` command. For example, if your Ballerina home directory is `C:\Ballerina_Home` on Windows, you would type `C:\Ballerina_Home\bin\ballerina build` followed by the options.

To build a Ballerina **executable** archive containing a `main()` function, use the following command to build the `.bmz` file:
```
ballerina build main <main-package-name> [-o filename] 
```

To build a Ballerina **service** archive containing one or more services, use the following command to build the `.bsz` file:
```
ballerina build service <pkg1> [<pkg2> <pkg3> ...] [-o filename]
```

**Note:** When specifying the package names in the `ballerina build` command, delineate them with slashes instead of periods, such as `org/foo/bar` instead of `org.foo.bar`. If you do not specify a name for the archive file using the `-o` flag, the archive will be named after the last part of the package name. 

For example, to archive the StockQuoteService described at the top of this page as a file called `StockQuoteService.bsz`, you would navigate to the C:\ directory and type: `ballerina build service myProgram/services -o StockQuoteService.bsz`

For a tutorial on creating archives, see [Create an Archive of your Program](../tutorials/create-archive.md).


## Running a Ballerina program

The `ballerina` command runs a Ballerina program/service in its packaged or unpackaged format.

To execute `main()` from a `.bal` file or a package or archive file:

```
ballerina run main (filename | packagename | mainarchive)
```

To run named services:

```
ballerina run service (filename | packagename | servicearchive)+ 
```

To run a collection of service archives from service root:

```
ballerina run service [-sr serviceroot]
```

## Creating and running a Docker image of the archive
After you have built an archive, you can create a Docker image of it and run it in the container. 

To create a Docker image from a Ballerina package, you run `ballerina docker` and provide the package name as an argument:

```
ballerina docker helloWorld.bmz
ballerina: build docker image [helloworld:latest] in docker host [localhost]? (y/n): y

ballerina: docker image helloworld:latest successfully built.

Use the following command to start a container.
        docker run --name determined_aluminum -it helloworld:latest

```

You can additionally provide a customized image name:

```
ballerina docker helloWorld.bmz -t myhelloworld:0.1
ballerina: build docker image [myhelloworld:0.1] in docker host [localhost]? (y/n): y

ballerina: docker image myhelloworld:0.1 successfully built.

Use the following command to start a container.
        docker run --name burning_aids -it myhelloworld:0.1

```

If you want to use a remote Docker daemon, you can specify it using the -H flag so the Docker image is created at the remote end:

```
ballerina docker helloWorld.bmz -H http://127.0.0.1:2375
ballerina: build docker image [myhelloworld:0.1] in docker host [http://127.0.0.1:2375]? (y/n): y

ballerina: docker image helloworld:latest successfully built.

Use the following command to start a container.
        docker run --name future_aquarium -it helloworld:latest
```

For more information on the usage of this command, type `ballerina docker --help`.
